Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)

We are building a loyalty program to replace the physical card punch program as discussed in email

Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)

We expect to include all of the elements that you require for the assignment

What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?

Work on it every day until completion which Im sure will be before the due date.

What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?

We started making the login and registration page so we have the rest of the project to work on.

You do not need to wait for my feedback to begin working on A4. If I see any problems with your idea I will contact you to discuss how you can address these. 

feel free to contact my partner Mitch.
