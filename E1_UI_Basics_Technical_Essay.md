I started out doing the WOD by just going through them step by step and researching all the things I didnt know it would take me about half an hour the first time. 
Then I would go back through and do them again. I watched the cast and it helped me see shortcuts I could take. 

My suggestion is to try to do them on your own by researching the code you need on your own at first. This way you remember it better. 
Then as you go back through and repeat them it sticks in your brain and you have to research less and less and you slowly get better at them. 

The hardest part for me was making time to sit down and do them. First we didnt do them until later in the semester and second I have a lot of classes and a
lot of things Im constantly balancing so just making appointments to code for an hour a day normally helps. making everything routine helps too. 

so having a regular time that is for coding everyday makes it more fluent.
